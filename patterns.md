## Creational


####  1.Singleton

Ensure a class has only **one instance**, and provide a single global point of access to it.

When to use examples:
  - basket in the internet-shop
  - intsance of the music player
  - logger

Implementation: 
  1. Create global variable and put it to the module.
  2. Singleton inside the object
